CONTENTS:
- Resources folder: Containes the starter data data for the challenge as well as the establishments json. Establishments json is the data imported into Mongo for analysis.
- NoSQL_analysis: Jupyter file containing code used to analyze the data. 
- NoSQL_setup: Jupyter file used to import data into mongoDB and create the database.

This challenge was used to acclimate me with mongoDB. The goal was to create a database and then manipulate it.

ISTRUCTIONS:
- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have Mongodb downloaded. This may require extra software in mongosh if you are using windows. 
- Use the terminal code in NoSQL_setup to import data into your Mongo database. Follow the notebook to ensure database is created.
- Ensure pandas exists in environment. Use NoSQL_analysis notebook to follow along with data engineering.

DATA SOURCES:
